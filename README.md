## Here is a use case example of utilizing pandas for EDA, Data Cleaning, and lastly visualizing datasets. ##



 ## The first step is loading the datasets as DateFrames from CSV files while simultaniously seeting the index for timeseries analysis.##

   # This Assignment stressed Importing Data with just one of the many pandas techniques to do so, EDA, Normalizing the data for comparison and using some basic visualization techniques that come with panndas.
